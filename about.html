				<h1>Bio</h1>
				
				<p style="text-indent:50px;"> 
				
					My name's Ahmed Elkady, and my life's been a tremendous journey. Having been born in Egypt and attended the International School of 
					Choueifat in Cairo, I was whisked away to Malaysia at the tender age of 8 where I attended the International School of Kuala Lumpur.
					I was in store for a bit of bouncing around, as I moved back to Egypt at the age of 10 and returned to Malaysia at the age of 12 (going to the same schools), where
					I was destined to spend my high school life. Having been to several countries in between, including but not limited to Singapore, China,
					Philippines, Thailand, and the UAE, my journey has taken me here, to being a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo in 
					Canada. Of course this voyage is far from over, and who knows what's in store for me next? 
				
				</p>
				
				<h1>Hobbies</h1>
				
				<p style="text-indent:50px;"> 
				
					When I'm not immersed in my studies or in my job, there are several other dimensions of my life. I always like to retreat into the world of literature.
					Fantasy novels in particular grab my attention, with the works of George R.R. Martin in particular and his A Song of Ice and Fire series
					never failing to amaze and intrigue. Other works of literature that I enjoy reading include the works of J.R.R. Tolkein and Dan Brown,
					as well as the Hunger Games series. I also often find myself lost in the world of TV Shows. Fascinating series like Breaking Bad,
					Mad Men, The Sopranos, The West Wing, House of Cards, Arrested Development and many many more never fail to provide me with a sense of fascination, wonder,
					and enjoyment. Finally, I occasionally dabble in the video game world, exploring classics such as the Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty 
					series.
				
				</p>
				
				<h1>Interests</h1>
				
				<p style="text-indent:50px;"> 
				
					As a kid, I never ran out of questions. My curiosity peaked when I took my first plane ride when I was 7 years old (or at least the 
					first plane ride I could remember). It was a ride that I would never forget. I felt dwarfed by the sheer size of the plane, the 
					monotonous hum of the engines, the fact that we were in the middle of the clouds and yet I couldn't tell. I ran across the whole expanse 
					of the plane, looking, inspecting, and feeding my insatiable curiosity. I somehow made my way to the front of the plane, where I managed 
					to catch a glimpse of the inside of the cockpit. The sheer array of buttons, the bright flashing lights, and the giant lever in the 
					middle left me wide-eyed in shock, my heartbeat accelerating. It was then, at that moment, that I knew that I wanted to be an engineer. 
				
				</p>
				
				<p style="text-indent:50px;"> 
				
					Whenever I thought about engineering, my mind would go back to that plane ride, because I knew that engineering would enable me to 
					satisfy my endless desire to learn and know more about how the world works. Being a computer engineer in particular would allow me to 
					deal with the more practical applications of engineering, namely electronics. I am interested in not only various aspects of the 
					electronics industry, both hardware and software, but also in the embedded systems and communication industries, as well as cryptography 
					and computer security. With this I can hopefully make my 7-year old self proud of the computer engineer that I want to be.
